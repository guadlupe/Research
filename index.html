      <h2>The Xbox</h2>
      <p>The <i>Xbox</i> was first created in 2001. It was a gaming console where you could play many different types of video games. This console was developed by Microsoft. Their first initial start to making this was that they wanted it to run
        like a pc and it was the first console to be brought up like this. Many thought it wasnâ€™t going to do well due to other competitors, but Microsoft proved them wrong. Then came xbox live where many people could connect through the internet to
        play together.</p>

      <h2>Xbox 360</h2>
      <p>As we all know this was a time of how many console brands would go against each other. When the <i>Xbox 360</i> was released, it had many problems. The main one was that the console would overheat so Microsoft extended their warranty. As all
        places Microsoft learned from what was going wrong in their system to fix it and have the console running better than ever. They wanted to make this console appealing to the gamers. It had a Kinect which is a type of software that let you
        give a voice command and gesture command to control the system. Another good feature that it had was that it improved on wireless controller and headset.</p>

      <h2>Xbox 360 S</h2>
      <p>The <i>Xbox One S</i> was much better and not as bulky as the first. Over the years we were able to make software systems much more compact and easier to install. This had a better processor and was able to work faster online. What I mean by
        this is that the connection was steadier, and we also had the Kinect software that let us control the system. This console was much more slimer.</p>

    <div class="Milestone4">
      <h2>Xbox 360 E</h2>
      <p>This console was more compact and a better version of the consoles before it. People said that it was much quieter and more convenient. Convenient being that they were able to connect to the HDMI and wifi faster. Its mother board was much
        more compact. It did have surround sound and the graphics were amazing.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="Milestone5">
      <h2>Xbox One</h2>
      <p>This <i>Xbox One</i> was one of a kind. It was the future of what many had seen. The thing about this console was that it had an internal self-cooling system that was able to cool a certain part of it when needed. The sound quality and image
        quality were to die for. It was a much smaller console, and it still included the Kinect system. You could also watch DVDs in it and much more. It also had more space for the storage your games.</p>
